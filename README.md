## About
### Background
Admin dashboard will be a website where admin can log in and manage the system. Admin will be able to manage all cities, scooters and user accounts in the system. On the first page, it should be possible to view general information about all registered cities, scooters and users. There will be sub-pages for map, urban areas, scooters and customers. Each page has a purpose for the user to be able to oversee and manage the area the page covers.

The page will be made with ReactJs and retrieve data from our REST API. Tailwind will be used as CSS framework for the style. The React router library will be used for navigation because React does not have page routing from the start.
